# Data source

Singapore's Government https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19 unfortunately does not
publish data in a machine readable form, despite [multiple data
requests](https://github.com/datagovsg/datagovsg-datasets/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+covid-19).

So we need to rely upon [data compiled by Center for Systems Science and
Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins
University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports).

Bizarrely sg.gov's past visualisation attempts like
https://go.gov.sg/covid-19-dashboard and **experience.arcgis.com** are _defunct_!
